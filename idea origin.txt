I first saw the game for LD where a theme was "One room". The game was a dungeon-crawler in a "one room dungeon", where the dungeon was reconstructed by robot arms every time player exited the room. My thought was:"That's lame, that's not a one room dungeon at all, it's just a regular multi-room dungeon with an additional transition animation".
Then I was playing through Persona 3 which has a mechanic called "Shuffle Time". Shuffle Time happens after some battles and it's essentially a bonus reward system, where different types of bonuses are represented by cards and there's an element of skill and luck in getting a specific card. I was looking at those cards and put this mechanic and an idea of one room dungeon together.
A dungeon which is created from cards, backside of cards, where cards can have enemies, rewards, or just some walls in them. And as you complete cards, they get replaced with new harder/better ones(stronger enemies, more powerfull items).
Two other card games I read about in the same month might have also something to do with this. Regency Solitaire and Solitaire variant in Shenzhen I/O. They just made me think about card games more.
