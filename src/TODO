mock up specific cards
implement weapons:
sword
spear(hits two squares, takes an extra turn?)
bow(hits in a line, takes an extra turn or requires arrows which are limited
make multi-turn weapons auto, can't cancel, next turn is performed automatically for you

be on the lookout for more movement bugs

CARD TYPES:
nothing card spawns some walls
dude card spawns some dudes then walls
treasure card spawns treasure then walls


there should be upper and lower limit for number of covered cards
something like: min of 30%, max of 70%
min is more important than max
so as player uncovers cards, each card has a timer
when player uncovers too many cards, cards are replaced earlier
when player uncovers cards too slowly, cards are gradually replaced

remove only cards that are completed and empty, prioritizing older cards, where age is tracked from the moment card is flipped
completed means:
treasure cards: opened chest(not picking up item is okay)
enemy: if enemy is moving, then doesn't matter, if enemy is static, then when all enemies belonging to card are dead
empty means:
no enemies or player, item is ok


USING ITEMS
click? - confused with drag
press number button - what if too many slots?
drag onto player - might make a mistake
right click - confusing
universal button for potions - there are other items
what about items that don't affect the player directly(bomb) - drag onto player doesn't make sense then


IDEAS:
20 arcana bosses might be too much, maybe make arcanas into spells/abilities and make kings/queens bosses
add attack controls for mouse too(going full WASD + mouse might be better)
dudes that just block the way and don't attack(but do move)
