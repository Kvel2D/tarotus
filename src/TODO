IDEAS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make enemy cards spawn treasure cards on completion

charging enemy, can only be hit from the back

laser weapons: powerful, no ammo, but take time to recharge

20 arcana bosses might be too much, maybe make arcanas into spells/abilities and make kings/queens bosses
dudes that just block the way and don't attack(but do move)
generate presets by generating a dungeon completely first and then breaking it down into elements

shop

break down weapons into materials, use materials at a blacksmith

WEAPON SLOT
currently only one weapon can be in inventory at a time
this makes a possible situation where you have a bow, run out of arrows and have no weapon to use
maybe make a specific weapon slot, and allow more weapons to be carried in inventory
but this might be a reasonable tradeoff for how powerful bow is, balance out with more opportunities for weapon replacement

CARD TYPES
to make sure there isn't too many or too little of one card type, keep track of spawned types for past 15 cards
nothing card spawns some walls
dude card spawns some dudes then walls
treasure card spawns treasure then walls


USING ITEMS
click? - confused with drag
press number button - what if too many slots?
drag onto player - might make a mistake
right click - confusing
universal button for potions - there are other items
what about items that don't affect the player directly(bomb) - drag onto player doesn't make sense then


AMOUNT OF COVERED CARDS
there should be upper and lower limit for number of covered cards
something like: min of 30%, max of 70%
min is more important than max
so as player uncovers cards, each card has a timer
when player uncovers too many cards, cards are replaced earlier
when player uncovers cards too slowly, cards are gradually replaced


CARD REMOVAL
remove only cards that are completed and empty, prioritizing older cards, where age is tracked from the moment card is flipped
completed means:
treasure cards: opened chest(not picking up item is okay)
enemy: if enemy is moving, then doesn't matter, if enemy is static, then when all enemies belonging to card are dead
empty means:
no enemies or player, item is ok
