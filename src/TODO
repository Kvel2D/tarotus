add card flip state and remove that weird card flip stopper for movement
card system
enemy hp indicator
mock up specific cards


CARD TYPES:
nothing card spawns some walls
dude card spawns some dudes then walls
treasure card spawns treasure then walls


there should be upper and lower limit for number of covered cards
something like: min of 30%, max of 70%
min is more important than max
so as player uncovers cards, each card has a timer
when player uncovers too many cards, cards are replaced earlier
when player uncovers cards too slowly, cards are gradually replaced


USING ITEMS
click? - confused with drag
press number button - what if too many slots?
drag onto player - might make a mistake
right click - confusing
universal button for potions - there are other items
what about items that don't affect the player directly(bomb) - drag onto player doesn't make sense then


IDEAS:
20 arcana bosses might be too much, maybe make arcanas into spells/abilities and make kings/queens bosses
maybe 4x4 is too small, 5x4 might be better
add attack controls for mouse too
enemies that just block the way and don't attack(but do move)
inventory is for everyting, so armor goes there too and you can drop armor if you want that one item but don't have enough space
